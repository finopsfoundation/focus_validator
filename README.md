# FOCUS (FinOps Open Source Cost and Usage Specification) Validator

Validator resource for checking datasets against the [FOCUS](https://focus.finops.org) specification.

## Overview

The FOCUS Validator is a comprehensive Python application designed to validate cloud cost and usage datasets against the FinOps Foundation's FOCUS specification. It provides a robust validation framework that can process large datasets, execute complex validation rules, and generate detailed reports about compliance with FOCUS standards.

## Codebase Architecture

The FOCUS Validator follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns. The codebase is organized into several key components:

### Core Architecture Overview

- Performance timing and logging
- Cross-platform file opening for visualizations

### 2. Validation Orchestrator (`validator.py`)

The `Validator` class is the central coordinator that manages the validation process:

- **Data Loading**: Delegates to appropriate data loaders based on file type
- **Rule Loading**: Manages FOCUS specification rule loading and version handling
- **Validation Execution**: Orchestrates rule execution against loaded datasets
- **Result Management**: Coordinates output formatting and result persistence
- **Performance Monitoring**: Integrated performance logging using decorators

**Key Responsibilities:**

- Version compatibility checking (local vs remote specifications)
- Applicability criteria processing and filtering
- Data and rule loading coordination
- Validation result aggregation and output

### 3. Config Objects (`config_objects/`)

This module contains the core validation logic and configuration management:

#### Rule Definition (`rule.py`)

- **ModelRule**: Pydantic model for FOCUS specification rules
- **ValidationCriteria**: Detailed validation requirements and conditions
- **CompositeCheck**: Support for complex AND/OR logic in rule dependencies
- **Status Management**: Rule lifecycle management (Active, Draft, etc.)

#### DuckDB Schema Conversion (`focus_to_duckdb_converter.py`)

The `FocusToDuckDBSchemaConverter` represents the most sophisticated component of the validation engine, implementing a comprehensive SQL code generation framework with advanced pattern matching, error recovery, and performance optimization:

**Internal Architecture & Core Components:**

**Check Generator Registry System:**

```python
CHECK_GENERATORS: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]] = {
    "ColumnPresent": {"generator": ColumnPresentCheckGenerator, "factory": lambda args: "ColumnName"},
    "TypeString": {"generator": TypeStringCheckGenerator, "factory": lambda args: "ColumnName"},
    "FormatDateTime": {"generator": FormatDateTimeGenerator, "factory": lambda args: "ColumnName"},
    "CheckModelRule": {"generator": CheckModelRuleGenerator, "factory": lambda args: "ModelRuleId"},
    "AND": {"generator": CompositeANDRuleGenerator, "factory": lambda args: "Items"},
    "OR": {"generator": CompositeORRuleGenerator, "factory": lambda args: "Items"}
    # ... 20+ total generators
}
```

**Generator Architecture Patterns:**

- **Abstract Base Class**: `DuckDBCheckGenerator` defines the contract with `REQUIRED_KEYS`, `DEFAULTS`, and `FREEZE_PARAMS` class variables
- **Template Method Pattern**: Subclasses implement `generateSql()` for SQL generation and `getCheckType()` for type identification
- **Factory Pattern**: Registry system enables dynamic generator selection based on FOCUS rule function names
- **Parameter Validation**: Automatic validation of required parameters using Pydantic-style checking with `REQUIRED_KEYS`
- **Immutable Parameters**: `FREEZE_PARAMS` creates read-only parameter objects using `MappingProxyType` for thread safety

**SQL Generation Framework:**

**Template System Architecture:**

- **Dual Template Support**: Handles both `{table_name}` and `{{table_name}}` patterns for backward compatibility
- **Parameter Substitution**: Safe parameter injection using `_lit()` method with SQL injection prevention
- **Dynamic SQL Construction**: Runtime SQL assembly based on rule requirements and data types
- **Query Optimization**: Template caching and SQL query plan reuse for repeated validations

**`build_check()` - Advanced Check Construction Pipeline:**

**Multi-Phase Construction Process:**

```python
# Detailed build_check() workflow
1. Rule Type Analysis → Determine generator class from CHECK_GENERATORS registry
2. Applicability Assessment → Evaluate rule inclusion via _should_include_rule()
3. Parameter Extraction → Parse ValidationCriteria.requirement for generator parameters
4. Generator Instantiation → Create generator with validated parameters and context
5. SQL Generation → Execute generateSql() with template substitution
6. Check Object Assembly → Wrap in DuckDBColumnCheck with metadata and execution context
7. Nested Check Handling → Recursively process composite rule children
8. Performance Optimization → Cache compiled checks for reuse
```

**Technical Implementation Details:**

**Dynamic Rule Processing:**

- **Rule Type Detection**: Uses `rule.is_dynamic()` to identify rules requiring runtime data analysis
- **Skipped Check Generation**: Creates `SkippedDynamicCheck` objects for rules that cannot be statically validated
- **Metadata Preservation**: Maintains rule context and reasoning for debugging and reporting

**Applicability Filtering Engine:**

```python
def _should_include_rule(self, rule, parent_edges=None) -> bool:
    # Hierarchical applicability checking
    1. Check rule's own ApplicabilityCriteria against validated_applicability_criteria
    2. Traverse parent_edges to validate entire dependency chain
    3. Apply AND logic - rule included only if all criteria in chain are satisfied
    4. Generate SkippedNonApplicableCheck for filtered rules
```

**Composite Rule Architecture:**

- **Recursive Descent Parsing**: Processes ValidationCriteria.requirement.Items recursively for nested AND/OR structures
- **Child Check Generation**: Each composite rule item becomes a separate DuckDBColumnCheck object
- **Logic Handler Assignment**: Assigns `operator.and_` or `operator.or_` functions for result aggregation
- **Dependency Context Propagation**: Passes parent results and edge context down to child generators

**`run_check()` - High-Performance Execution Engine:**

**Multi-Level Execution Strategy:**

```python
# Comprehensive execution pipeline
1. Connection Validation → Ensure DuckDB connection is active and prepared
2. Check Type Dispatch → Route to appropriate execution path (skipped/leaf/composite)
3. SQL Template Resolution → Substitute table names and parameters safely
4. Query Execution → Execute with comprehensive error handling and recovery
5. Result Processing → Parse DuckDB results and format for aggregation
6. Error Analysis → Extract column names from error messages for intelligent reporting
7. Nested Aggregation → Process composite rule children and apply logic operators
8. Performance Metrics → Capture execution timing and resource usage
```

**Advanced Error Recovery System:**

**Missing Column Detection:**

```python
def _extract_missing_columns(err_msg: str) -> List[str]:
    # Multi-pattern column extraction from DuckDB error messages
    patterns = [
        r'Column with name ([A-Za-z0-9_"]+) does not exist',
        r'Binder Error: .*? column ([A-Za-z0-9_"]+)',
        r'"([A-Za-z0-9_]+)" not found'
    ]
    # Returns sorted list of missing column names for precise error reporting
```

**SQL Error Classification:**

- **Syntax Errors**: Template substitution failures and malformed SQL detection
- **Schema Mismatches**: Column type conflicts and missing table detection  
- **Data Validation Errors**: Constraint violations and format validation failures
- **Performance Issues**: Timeout detection and resource exhaustion handling

**Composite Rule Execution Engine:**

**Upstream Dependency Short-Circuiting:**

```python
# Advanced dependency failure handling
if upstream_failure_detected:
    1. Mark all child checks as failed with upstream reason
    2. Preserve failure context and dependency chain information
    3. Skip actual SQL execution to avoid cascading errors
    4. Generate detailed failure report with root cause analysis
```

**Result Aggregation Logic:**

- **AND Logic**: `all(child_results)` - requires all children to pass
- **OR Logic**: `any(child_results)` - requires at least one child to pass
- **Failure Propagation**: Maintains detailed failure context including which specific children failed
- **Performance Optimization**: Early termination for AND (first failure) and OR (first success) operations

**Advanced SQL Generation Patterns:**

**Type-Specific Generators:**

**ColumnPresentCheckGenerator:**

```sql
WITH col_check AS (
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS found
    FROM information_schema.columns
    WHERE table_name = '{table_name}' AND column_name = '{column_name}'
)
SELECT 
    CASE WHEN found = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS violations,
    CASE WHEN found = 0 THEN '{error_message}' END AS error_message
FROM col_check
```

**TypeStringCheckGenerator:**

```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS violations,
    '{column_name} must be string type' AS error_message
FROM {table_name}
WHERE {column_name} IS NOT NULL 
    AND typeof({column_name}) != 'VARCHAR'
```

**FormatDateTimeGenerator:**

```sql
WITH datetime_violations AS (
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS violations
    FROM {table_name}
    WHERE {column_name} IS NOT NULL 
        AND TRY_STRPTIME({column_name}, '{expected_format}') IS NULL
)
SELECT violations, 
    CASE WHEN violations > 0 
        THEN '{column_name} format violations: ' || violations || ' rows'
    END AS error_message
FROM datetime_violations
```

**Performance & Memory Optimization:**

**Connection Management:**

- **Connection Pooling**: Reuses DuckDB connections across multiple validations
- **Memory Monitoring**: Tracks memory usage for large dataset processing
- **Query Plan Caching**: DuckDB query plan reuse for repeated validation patterns
- **Parallel Execution**: Thread-safe generator design for concurrent validation

**Algorithmic Efficiency:**

- **Lazy Evaluation**: SQL queries only executed when results are needed
- **Batch Processing**: Groups similar validations for bulk execution
- **Result Streaming**: Processes large result sets without loading entire datasets into memory
- **Index Utilization**: Generates SQL that leverages DuckDB's columnar indices

**Extensibility Framework:**

**Custom Generator Development:**

```python
class CustomCheckGenerator(DuckDBCheckGenerator):
    REQUIRED_KEYS = {"ColumnName", "ThresholdValue"}
    DEFAULTS = {"TolerancePercent": 0.1}
    
    def generateSql(self) -> str:
        # Custom SQL generation logic
        return f"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM {{table_name}} WHERE {self.params.ColumnName} > {self.params.ThresholdValue}"
    
    def getCheckType(self) -> str:
        return "custom_threshold_check"
```

**Registry Integration:**

- **Dynamic Registration**: New generators can be added to CHECK_GENERATORS at runtime
- **Parameter Validation**: Automatic validation using REQUIRED_KEYS and type checking
- **Factory Function**: Consistent parameter extraction across all generator types
- **Metadata Preservation**: Full context and provenance tracking for custom validations

#### Rule Dependency Resolution (`rule_dependency_resolver.py`)

The `RuleDependencyResolver` is the most sophisticated component in the validation engine, implementing advanced graph algorithms to analyze complex rule interdependencies and optimize execution paths:

**Internal Architecture & Data Structures:**

The resolver maintains three core data structures for efficient dependency management:

- **`dependency_graph`**: `Dict[str, Set[str]]` mapping rule_id → {dependent_rule_ids} representing forward edges
- **`reverse_graph`**: `Dict[str, List[str]]` mapping rule_id → [rules_that_depend_on_this] for backward traversal
- **`in_degree`**: `Dict[str, int]` tracking prerequisite counts for Kahn's algorithm implementation

**`buildDependencyGraph()` - Advanced Dependency Analysis:**

**Algorithm Implementation:**

```python
# Pseudocode for dependency graph construction
1. Filter rules by target prefix (e.g., "BilledCost*")
2. Recursively collect transitive dependencies using BFS
3. Build bidirectional graph structures for O(1) lookups
4. Calculate in-degree counts for topological processing
5. Validate graph integrity and detect potential cycles
```

**Technical Details:**

- **Rule Filtering**: Supports prefix-based filtering (e.g., `target_rule_prefix="BilledCost"`) to process subsets of the full rule graph, essential for large FOCUS specifications with 200+ rules
- **Transitive Closure**: Uses `_collectAllDependencies()` with deque-based BFS to recursively discover all child dependencies, ensuring composite rules include their nested components even when they don't match the prefix filter
- **Graph Construction**: Builds forward and reverse adjacency lists simultaneously for O(1) dependency lookups during execution
- **Memory Optimization**: Uses `defaultdict(set)` and `defaultdict(list)` to minimize memory allocation overhead
- **Cycle Prevention**: Maintains processed sets to prevent infinite recursion during dependency discovery

**Composite Rule Propagation:**

- **Condition Inheritance**: Implements `_propagate_composite_conditions()` to push parent composite rule conditions down to child rules via private attributes
- **CheckModelRule Processing**: Analyzes ValidationCriteria.requirement.Items to identify referenced rules and propagate preconditions
- **Runtime Condition Evaluation**: Child rules inherit parent conditions and evaluate them dynamically during execution

**`getTopologicalOrder()` - Advanced Graph Algorithms:**

**Kahn's Algorithm Implementation:**

```python
# Enhanced Kahn's algorithm with cycle detection
1. Initialize in-degree counts from dependency graph
2. Queue all zero-degree nodes (no prerequisites)
3. Process nodes level by level, updating dependent in-degrees
4. Detect cycles when remaining nodes > 0 after processing
5. Handle circular dependencies by appending remaining nodes
```

**Cycle Detection & Analysis:**

- **Tarjan's SCC Algorithm**: Implements `_tarjan_scc()` for strongly connected component detection with O(V+E) complexity
- **Cycle Visualization**: `_export_scc_dot()` generates Graphviz DOT files for each strongly connected component, enabling visual debugging of complex cycles
- **Simple Cycle Reconstruction**: `_find_simple_cycle()` uses DFS with path tracking to identify specific circular dependency chains
- **Detailed Cycle Logging**: Provides comprehensive cycle analysis including component sizes, adjacency matrices, and example cycle paths

**Advanced Debugging & Instrumentation:**

**Graph Analytics:**

- **`_log_graph_snapshot()`**: Captures comprehensive graph metrics (node count, edge count, zero-degree nodes) with sampling
- **`_trace_node()`**: Implements bounded DFS to trace dependency chains up to configurable depth for debugging blocked nodes
- **`_dump_blockers()`**: Analyzes remaining nodes after topological sort to identify specific blocking dependencies

**Performance Monitoring:**

- **Edge Counting**: Tracks total dependency relationships for complexity analysis
- **Zero-Degree Analysis**: Identifies entry points (rules with no dependencies) for parallel execution opportunities
- **Blocking Analysis**: Detailed reporting of rules that cannot be scheduled due to unsatisfied prerequisites

**`build_plan_and_schedule()` - Execution Plan Optimization:**

**PlanBuilder Integration:**

```python
# Advanced execution planning workflow
1. Create PlanBuilder with filtered relevant rules
2. Build parent-preserving forest from entry points
3. Compile to layered ValidationPlan for parallel execution
4. Apply runtime context and edge predicates
5. Generate deterministic scheduling with tie-breaking
```

**Technical Implementation:**

- **Forest Construction**: Uses `builder.build_forest(roots)` to create parent-preserving execution trees that maintain rule relationships
- **Compilation Pipeline**: Transforms abstract plan graph into concrete ValidationPlan with index-based node references for O(1) lookups
- **Edge Context Propagation**: Maintains EdgeCtx objects throughout planning to preserve dependency reasoning and conditional activation
- **Execution Context**: Supports runtime `exec_ctx` parameter for dynamic rule filtering and conditional execution paths

**Memory & Performance Optimizations:**

**Data Structure Efficiency:**

- **Deque-Based Processing**: Uses `collections.deque` for BFS traversals to minimize memory reallocation
- **Set Operations**: Leverages Python set operations for O(1) membership testing and efficient union/intersection operations  
- **Processed Tracking**: Maintains processed sets to prevent redundant work during recursive dependency discovery

**Algorithmic Complexity:**

- **Graph Construction**: O(V + E) where V = rules, E = dependencies
- **Topological Sort**: O(V + E) with Kahn's algorithm
- **SCC Detection**: O(V + E) with Tarjan's algorithm
- **Memory Usage**: O(V + E) for graph storage with minimal overhead

**Applicability Criteria Integration:**

**Dynamic Rule Filtering:**

- **Criteria Validation**: Supports `validated_applicability_criteria` parameter for runtime rule inclusion/exclusion
- **Hierarchical Processing**: Always includes rules in dependency graph but marks them for potential skipping during execution
- **SkippedNonApplicableCheck Generation**: Defers actual filtering to execution phase via converter's applicability checking

#### Plan Building (`plan_builder.py`)

- **Execution Planning**: Creates layered execution plans optimized for parallel processing
- **Edge Context Management**: Tracks why dependencies exist with conditional activation predicates  
- **Topological Scheduling**: Implements Kahn's algorithm with deterministic tie-breaking for consistent execution order
- **Parent Preservation**: Maintains parent-child relationships throughout the planning process for result aggregation
